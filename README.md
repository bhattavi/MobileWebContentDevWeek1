This was an assignment which was as follows:

Assignments: Initial Web Page

Make a simple web page, about anything you’d like. Use CSS to style it and JavaScript to add a little interactivity.
At a minimum, please use the IMG, SECTION, DIV, VIDEO, and BUTTON HTML tags, and the color, background-color, font, and transition CSS styles. Use shadows and gradients. Links to the MDN documentation on these and other tags and styles is at the end of this document.
Change the look of the page when the user clicks on a button. You can change anything you like in the page, except either the src of an image or the wording of text on the page.
In the page, use at least two HTML tags and two CSS styles that you think no-one else in the class will have used.
The page can be simple and does not need to be complicated to get full marks. However, it is important to create the HTML and CSS yourself, and not to paste in code from the internet or from other people’s work. Do not use code libraries (eg Bootstrap) or any languages other than HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
